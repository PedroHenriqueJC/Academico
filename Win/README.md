To use this script you need to made some changes in the .bat and in the .py files. I'm using some kinds of directory and it need to be change.

Trying to not use other kinds of language in that project I created a kind of homebrew database using python and text files.

I had a problem with my version of python, I can't acess other files in other directories, it runned in a exception. So, to bypass this I created a .bat file to get the file to the current directory.
